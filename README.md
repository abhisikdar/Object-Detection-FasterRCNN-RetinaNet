We take full responsibility of the code provided.

## About:
We use PyTorch for all the following parts.
  1) Training Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet on PASCAL VOC 2007
  2) Calculating mAP at various IoU thresholds and plotting mAP vs IoU
  3) Training RetinaNet with only Cross Entropy loss
  4) Report class-wise Average Precisions for both the models
  5) Visualize the models in action
